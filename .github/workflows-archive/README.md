# Archived GitHub Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Action workflows that have been archived and are not currently active.

## Files

### `copilot-agent.yml`
- **Purpose**: Automated development with GitHub Copilot integration
- **Archived**: To prevent automated runs on cronjob schedule
- **Future Use**: Could be useful for automated development tasks
- **To Re-enable**: Move back to `.github/workflows/` directory

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

These workflows represent valuable automation that could be useful in the future. Rather than losing the work, we archive them here with clear documentation about their purpose and how to re-enable them if needed.
