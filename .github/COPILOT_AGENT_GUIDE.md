# Automated Development Issues for GitHub Copilot Agent

This directory contains automated development tasks that can be assigned to GitHub Copilot's coding agent for autonomous completion.

## How to Use GitHub Copilot Agent

### 1. Setup (One-time)
1. **Upgrade to GitHub Copilot Pro**: Go to https://github.com/settings/copilot and upgrade to Pro ($10/month)
2. **Enable Coding Agent**: Enable the coding agent feature (currently in preview)
3. **Repository Configuration**: The agent is now configured to work with your repository

### 2. Create Issues for Automated Development
Create GitHub issues with the `copilot-agent` label and the agent will automatically:
- Analyze the issue
- Plan the implementation
- Write the code
- Run tests
- Create a pull request
- Iterate based on feedback

### 3. Current Priority Tasks

#### High Priority (Ready for Copilot Agent)
1. **Fix Partition Metadata Replication** - `copilot-agent` `high-priority`
   - Issue: Follower nodes don't receive partition metadata from leader
   - Solution: Implement Raft-based metadata replication (work already started)

2. **Add Comprehensive Testing** - `copilot-agent` `testing`
   - Add unit tests for all components
   - Add integration tests for multi-node scenarios
   - Add performance benchmarks

3. **Implement Cluster Join Logic** - `copilot-agent` `feature`
   - Complete the `joinCluster` method in server.go
   - Add node discovery and handshake
   - Add cluster state synchronization

4. **Add Monitoring and Observability** - `copilot-agent` `observability`
   - Add Prometheus metrics
   - Add structured logging
   - Add health checks
   - Add distributed tracing

5. **Optimize Performance** - `copilot-agent` `performance`
   - Implement batch operations
   - Add connection pooling
   - Optimize serialization
   - Add caching layer

#### Medium Priority
6. **Add Security Features** - `copilot-agent` `security`
   - TLS encryption
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation

7. **Add Backup and Recovery** - `copilot-agent` `backup`
   - Snapshot creation
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Cross-region replication
   - Automated backups

8. **Add Administration Tools** - `copilot-agent` `tooling`
   - CLI admin commands
   - Web dashboard
   - Configuration management
   - Cluster management UI

## Example Issue Template

```markdown
## Title: Fix Partition Metadata Replication in Multi-Node Cluster

### Problem
Follower nodes in a multi-node cluster don't receive partition metadata from the leader node, causing "failed to find partition" errors.

### Current Behavior
- Leader node: "Partition manager started with 1 partitions" ✅
- Follower nodes: "Partition manager started with 0 partitions" ❌

### Expected Behavior
All nodes should have the same partition metadata replicated through Raft consensus.

### Technical Details
- Files involved: `internal/raft/statemachine.go`, `internal/server/server.go`, `internal/partition/manager.go`
- The Raft state machine needs to handle metadata operations
- Cluster initialization should use Raft for metadata replication
- Partition manager should load metadata from Raft state

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All nodes show same partition count after cluster startup
- [ ] Metadata operations are replicated through Raft
- [ ] Multi-node integration tests pass
- [ ] No "failed to find partition" errors

### Labels
`copilot-agent`, `high-priority`, `bug`, `distributed-consensus`
```

## Benefits of Using Copilot Agent

1. **24/7 Development**: Works while you sleep
2. **No Manual Prompting**: Just create issues and assign them
3. **Full Context**: Understands your entire codebase
4. **Test-Driven**: Automatically runs tests and fixes issues
5. **Professional Quality**: Follows best practices and coding standards
6. **Iterative**: Responds to feedback and improves

## Monitoring Progress

The agent will:
- Comment on issues with progress updates
- Create draft PRs for review
- Run all tests automatically
- Request human review when needed
- Merge PRs when all checks pass

## Next Steps

1. **Upgrade to Copilot Pro**: https://github.com/settings/copilot
2. **Create the first issue** using the template above
3. **Add the `copilot-agent` label**
4. **Assign the issue to the coding agent**
5. **Watch the magic happen!**

The agent will start working immediately and you can track progress through GitHub notifications and PR updates.
